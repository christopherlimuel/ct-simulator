# CT-Scan Translation-Rotation Simulation
- Runs on Streamlit
- Generate sinogram data from image
- Reconstruct image from sinogram data with FBP algorithm
- Play with different parameters: num of translation, num of rotation, kVp (tube voltage peak), mA (tube current)

### Deployment
- Create new environment (optional)
- Make sure ```main.py``` and ```utils.py``` are in the same directory
- Run ```pip install -r requirements.txt ``` on terminal
- Run ```streamlit run main.py``` on terminal
